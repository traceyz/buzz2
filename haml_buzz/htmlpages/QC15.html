                <td colspan="4">My 4 year old Bose headphones stopped working.  I went to the kiosk that sells Bose at the airport, although I had bought them over the internet.  The people at the kiosk  tried to fix them but could not.  Bose gave me a $200 discount on a new pair of Headphones that I was able to use right then.  I really appreciated the fact  that they stand behind their products.  So although they are pricy, if you have problems they don't abandon you---even after 4 years.

I travel a lot and used to have sony headphones. Treated myself for my birthday and paid what I thought was an outlandish amount of money but was I in for a surprise. Should have bought these years ago. Quality product, excellent sound, and very light. You wont even realize they are on your head.

                <td colspan="4">These headphones do a remarkable job of diminishing background noise, and their audio fidelity is excellent.  My only complaints are that they are so big that carrying them in my messenger bag is a struggle and that it uses a battery that must be replaced after about 34 hours of use.  Why not have a discreetly hidden charging port and use a rechargeable, built-in battery?  Maybe the 16 will do that. Note that when you have the headphones on and are not listening to music, there is a high-pitched buzz that can be annoying.  The volume of the buzz is very low, and the frequency of the pitch is so high that many won't hear it--but it is there.</td>

                <td colspan="4">Definitely not worth the price they charge. The noise cancelling feature is super annoying in terms of perceived ear pressure, and can not be turned off when listening to music. Also, when just using them with noise cancelling only and no music at a coffee shop (or with music playing), it only drowns out fans and a/c units and actually amplifies peoples' voices. It is hard to concentrate on studying when I am getting a crystal clear conversation in my ears from across the room. returned and purchased something much cheaper that does a better job

                <td colspan="4">I want to focus this review on what the main purpose of these headphones is ... to cancel out unwanted background noise, especially when flying.  I've owned a pair of Sony NC phones prior to this and they did a good job.  This pair of headphones does an EXCELLENT job.  I fly a lot (weekly) and having this little respite from the noise of the flight is a pleasure.  My advice is to take Bose up on their 30 day money back guarantee and try them.  The background quiets down a little when you put them on and when you hit the power switch, it's like walking into a quiet room.  Does the noise go away completely?  Of course not.  Does the noise level drop like a rock?  You bet.  These headphones do what they were designed to do.Just a comment on sound quality.  Is the sound reproduction as good as my $500 Sennheisers?  Of course not.  But it is very good on this Bose pair and also, if I were to use the Sennheisers on an airplane, I'm pretty sure the perceived sound reproduction would not be perfect either.  These headphones are intended to balance noise cancelling with sound quality and they do this very well.The only downside is battery usage but it's more of an inconvenience than a cost issue.  The headset uses inexpensive AAA batteries but life (as stated by Bose support) is about 24 hours.  I'm guessing less, like about 15 to 20.  These headphones won't let you listen to music if the battery is dead like my Sony phones did, so I suggest putting a spare or two in the pocket of the included hard shell carry pouch.

But then I read a review that said something along the lines of 'I am bothered quite a bit by spurious noises such as a neighbor's lawn mower, the person in the adjacent apartment playing music, the guy talking on his mobile, someone in the family chewing food loudly . . .' And then I thought 'Hmmmm, sounds like me!' So I plunked down $300. After the headphones arrived, I put them on and then turned on the little switch, and miracle of miracles, the distracting noises in my environment melted away. Still a lot of money, but worth the increase in my sanity and concentrating ability.

                <td colspan="4">This is the third set of noise cancelling headphones that I buy.  Before I had a set of Sennheiser and a set of Sony.  After a week of fairly constant use (I listen to music at work nearly 4 hours every day) here are my impressions:The headphones are incredibly comfortable. The padding on the ears is very soft and doesn't apply any pressure against your head.  I can wear these headphones for hours and will not feel a thing.  Quite a difference from other models 'over the ear' that put extra pressure and caused me pain.The top of the headphones is also padded and I don't get ugly lines on my head from wearing them (I'm bald :P)Noise cancelling is much greater than any other headphones I used in the past.  It's very effective.  Once you start listening to music all noises are virtually eliminated.I can see how audiophiles would not like these headphones.  I can tell that Bose makes use of 'artifacts' in order to make the music sound good.  It doesn't bother me though.  The music *does* sound good, if you get over the fact that it's not 'pure' audio you can really enjoy it.  In my case I'm even able to listen to music at a slightly lower volume than I did before with my Sony noise cancelling, so I like I'm somehow helping preserve my hearing :)I like that it comes with two cables, one of them for iPhone so I can change the volume and skip songs easily.  It also has a microphone to hold phone conversations, but it feels really odd since you can barely hear your own voice.  It's good for those situations when you are listening to music and want to take a quick call, but I wouldn't use them for regular phone calls.The case is also quite nice.  Headphones don't fold, they just lay flat on the case, but the 'flatness' makes it very appealing for sticking into a laptop bag when traveling.It's a bit disappointing that you can't listen to music unless noise cancelling is enabled, but I knew about this before I bought them.  So far I haven't found that to be a problem.  I'm still using the same battery that was provided with the set so can't comment on how quickly I'll need to replace them.

I can still hear the noisy coworkers with the headphones on, but when I play music, they are pretty much blocked out. The sound is amazing and they are extremely comfortable. I have sensitive ears and found the comfort to be remarkable. If you're looking to block out all noise, then these are not for you. You should look at getting canal phones instead. I have a pair of ER-6i's and they block out all noise. However, they're uncomfortable and not practical for daily, extended use. If you're looking to block out most noise and have great sound, then the QC15's are for you.

                <td colspan="4">There is a certain 'lightness' in the sound quality of these headphones, particularly noticeable in the treble range - guitar strums are more apparent, cymbals are more sharper, spoken words are more vivid especially for tracks that you frequent, you hear sounds and tones you wouldn't normally notice. The bass range is set about right, not too heavy but not light either. Quite frankly, if all your music is in this lower range, you'd probably won't need these. To describe my sound experience in a few words, it is as if you are suddenly listening to the tracks you frequent with more sources/channels; in classical music, I am able to isolate (for those who can play by ear) and follow the musical instruments much easier whenever I choose. The sound canceling is aggressive, and I would be interested to try other devices out there that match or exceed this.For headphones that come with noise canceling, very few come close to the QC15, and at the end of the day, if you can afford these and noise canceling is part of your checklist, by all means go ahead as you will not regret it - these headphone do deliver at the price range they are set at.

Before these, I had a set of $30 earbuds (not cheap, but not top of the line) and I used to have to crank my iPod up to the max in order to hear podcasts clearly when on the plane. With these headphones, I no longer have to do that. The sound quality is very good and they cancel nearly all of the background noise when in use, but the price is a deterrent. One other downside is that they have to be turned 'on' in order for any sound to come out whatsoever, so they cannot be used during takeoffs and landings.</td>

                <td colspan="4">You can look up all the technical specifications you like else where. I will attempt to explain why I keep going back to the Bose QC Headphone series. Bose has always been known for their quality (as well as their price). The only downside to having them is that everyone you know will want to borrow them.I purchased these headphones primarily for use during noisy flights. While noise cancelling headphones do not completely block out noise they do an incredible job of blocking out background noise especially noise that is fairly constant. The only way to get a complete grasp on this is to try them at a Bose store, which I highly recommend doing.The headphones are extremely comfortable. They are lightweight and can be worn for hours. I often fall asleep with them on and have no with discomfort with them at any time.I am not an &quot;audiophile&quot; so I cannot give expert advice on the sound quality the QC 15 headphones provide, however the quality is definitely not bad. I feel it is quite satisfactory although I only casually listen to music or movies.Yes these headphones are expensive but you get what you pay for. Bose is unmatched in their noise canceling technology. They are largely considered the best in the industry. Since my first pair I have had to purchase two more pairs, not because they broke, but as gifts. After trying them on a flight, first my mother, and then friend had to have their own pair. This made an excellent gift for them!These are run using one AAA battery, the case for them has a space to hold several extras if you feel the need to. Its hard to say how long it holds charge for but I'd guess over 20 hours. One negative with these headphones is that as soon as your battery dies so does the sound. You need to have power to run these headphones. However the battery life is so good and it is easy enough to carry spare AAA batteries that this is hardly a problem.People with very sensitive ears may experience a feeling of unequal pressure in their ears when using these headphones, especially at high altitudes.Overall a great product, I prefer the &quot;around the ear&quot; design rather than the &quot;on ear&quot; design because I feel the &quot;on ear&quot; design would become uncomfortable after long periods of time. This is simply personal preference and I would again recommend you try the different styles before you buy them.

There was no comparison with the Bose QC15's.Sound is fantastic, and even having the headphones on without any music gives you a chance to hear how amazing the noise cancelling technology is.The only drawback downside is that these headphones do leak a lot of sound. If you have the music volume turned up, others in the vicinity are likely to hear it too. I would have expected better sound containment, given the cushioned ear pieces. However, the sound is so great that you can lower the volume and still hear elements of your music that you never even knew existed.Expensive, yes. Worthwhile, definitely.</td>

They cut out background noise perfectly. There is nothing wrong with these headphones. It is a matter of personal preference to pay the price. I am returning them today just cannot justify the price I paid for them for how much I will use them or the sound quality. $300.00 is way too much for these. Sound is great but in reality they are not much better than the $29.99 pair of Sony earbuds I have owned for over 2 years.If I was a frequent traveler on aircraft I would keep them. Do not get me wrong they are very good quality headphone. It all comes down to personal preference. Do I or don't I you be the judge.</td>

These headphones are very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, and I wear glasses so the fact they fit over the ear is very important. The only comfort note I would add is they are warm. If you are going to wear them for more than 20-30 minutes you may find your ears getting quite warm. The noise cancelling operations of the headphones is truly incredible. You put them on, turn them on and the outside world melts away. While I haven't flown with them yet, I have used them at work to reduce distractions. Listening to music or gaming sound FX is a real treat with these headphones. Everything is so clear and the lows are unbelievable. I have wanted a set of these for years and was so excited to receive them as a gift for Christmas this year. The fact that it comes with a cable that allows iPhone interface is a nice feature. They are, in my opinion definitely worth the price.</td>

I put these on, and it really REALLY cuts down on the noise, then when your playing music, you can't hear any background noise at all. I wore them for over a year on the ship, for hours on end and they still look and preform like new. THANK YOU BOSE for making an excellent product.A buddy had Dr Dre Beats, and in a head to head comparison, it was no contest on which were the better headphones, in noise cancellation and quality of the music we were playing.

                <td colspan="4">The detachable audio device cracked after just one month of use. I can see the wires inside right where I plug the cable into the laptop. I have been using the headphones every day for a month, but I expected Bose to hold up to heavy use, given their reputation and steep price. I also expected Bose to replace the wire, since the headphone are still covered by the limited warranty. To my surprise, the person I spoke on the phone with seemed to suggest I was to blame for the crack without even asking what had happened and stated quite strongly that the wire is not covered by the limited warranty. I was really surprised by the arrogant attitude I received from Bose. Yes, they make good headphones, but we pay lots of money for them and would appreciate full warranty and reassurance should something happen. The guy was though quick to offer to sell me another cable! This is not my first set of Bose headphones, but will certainly be my last. I am quite disappointed by their attitude towards their customers who are the ones giving them the money.

For example, I suffer from anxiety, which is why I like to wear them all the time. I tend to spend a lot of time in front of my computer to work (and play), and during those (long) periods of time, I wear them always. They help me every day with the tremendous calming effect that they have on me and they're so incredibly comfortable that I sometimes forget that I have them on at all.Another good example is airplane noise: I had never been able to sleep on planes before getting these. I actually look forward to flying again, because I know that when I take them out of their (very sturdy and sufficiently protective) case that is included, I'm about to cancel out the crying babies, people bickering, talking on cellphones, etc. You know who you are! ;-) The sound of the aircraft never really bothered me but it, too, is muffled to where it is reduced to little more than a distant and almost pleasant white noise.Incidentally, these headphones are pretty good at playing back music, too. Ha! No, really! No matter what you like to listen to, the QC-15's will reproduce music phenomenally and accurately. Go get 'em. :-)</td>

Sennheiser PXC 450Background: I'm not a specialist or some audiophile just an average guy looking for a nice pair of noise cancelling headphones. I bought both of these for a side by side comparison to determine which would be the best fit for my niche for noise cancelling headphones that I was missing in my life, after playing with both of them for a few days I'm definitely siding with Team Bose.Size:1) Bose - these headphones are very compact and easy to store and not too big they feel just right on my head.2) Sennheiser - I actually though the PXC 450 were kind of heavy, after using it for a few hours I felt my neck kind of strained and didn't want to keep in on. As as result, the case for this is also quite big too, almost like another laptop bag.Comfort:1) Bose - these headphones are amazingly comfortable, they are truly as many others have mentioned, gives you the feeling that they melt into your head.2) Sennheiser - As brought up earlier for my size concern, I found these too big for me, it was just so uncomfortable to have this huge thing over my head.Audio Quality/Noise Cancellation:1) Bose - The audio quality is pretty good, but the noise cancelling is just amazing, Bose really aren't kidding in their commercials when they say these cancels around 90% of the sound around you.2) Sennheiser - The audio quality is decent, some other reviewers have indicated that the sound quality is far superior to the Bose, maybe that is true but the fact that the Sennheisers severely lack in the noise cancellation department, I really couldn't tell as all this external sound was around even with the headphones on.Features:1) Bose - simple and by simple I mean just an on and off button.2) Sennheiser - the really significant feature to this is the volume adjustment button, which I'm sure newer models of Bose's headphones will probably include.Pricing: (as of 01.21.12)1) Bose QuietComfort 15 - $299.952) Sennheiser PXC 450 - $349.95Overall:1) Bose - For me, Bose is still King2) Sennheiser - I really felt these were lacking and left a lot to the imagination.

                <td colspan="4">This is my first Bose product. I bought it on Dec 23 2011 mainly due to its noise cancelling feature so that I will be able to use it while driving to work.  I might have used it  10 days or less listening to my ipod and I realized yesterday that it doesn't work anymore.  Still it is not even 30 days since I bought this.  I am going to return it to the store tomorrow.  I am very disappointed with the quality of this expensive head phone set.  I like the noise cancelling feature but quality is not much to be desired.  So think twice before you make your decision.

                <td colspan="4">Before buying the Bose noise-canceling headphones, I had another name brand. The reason I had purchased the other brand was there were considerably cheaper than the Bose. When I tested them in the store, they didn't seem to have a huge difference from the Bose. After using them other brand for a couple flights, I found I wasn't impressed. I could still hear the roar of the plane when wearing them, they were slightly uncomfortable on my ears and they diminished the quality of the music. The quality of the music is important to me. With another flight coming up, I decided to bit the bullet and buy the more expensive Bose. I do not regret that decision. The technology that Bose uses to reduce the noise of the plane, does not reduce the quality of the music. I noticed that the Bose reduced the plane noise much more than the other name brand did. And, the Bose headphone also fit more comfortably over the ears, which is great on those longer flights. If quality of music and comfort are important, then the Bose noise-canceling headphones are the way to go!</td>

However, my reluctance to purchase quickly changed when I tried a pair on and listened to difference in the sound / music and most importantly for me, the noise reduction. Its amazing how well these headphones work, and they are a bit slimmer and lighter than the QC2s. The case is slimmer too.</td>

                <td colspan="4">Okay... here is how my Bose story goes.I first really wanted the QuietComfort 3's.. mainly because of their sleek and compact size.. I tried them on in the Bose store as well as the QuietComfort 15's. I thought both were comfortable, but I ended up choosing the QC3's (even after the store clerk tried to convince me to buy the QC15's!) The clerk told me there have been complaints about pressure on the ear and side of the head. I literally laughed thinking that it was a ridiculous remark..&quot;how much pressure could they possibly put?..these are top of the line! people complain too much.&quot;I got home and unwrapped my QC3's excited as ever! I put them on thinking &quot;Ah, I'm so glad I got these...&quot;I wore my headphones for about 2-3 hours that night.. (I'm headed to Australia with a 14 hour flight coming up, so I needed to make sure I could wear them for long periods of time...yes I would take breaks as you are supposed to do with ANY headphones). All I need to say to sum up the rest of my night is that I had a horrible headache down into my neck and shoulders. I didn't know what it was really, and I convinced myself it was from stress at work!The next few nights I tried the same thing. Horrible headache and pain, one night I even went to bed kind of dizzy. I kept on convincing myself it couldn't be these $300 + headphones!I finally admitted to myself that I need to get the QC15's. I exchanged them no problem at the Bose store (within 90 days), and got the QC15's, and an extra $50 reimbursement for the price difference of the 3's and 15's. The pain is gone, the noise cancellation is EVEN BETTER and I am just overall so much more comfortable with the QC15's. The (SINGLE AAA BATTERY) lasts much longer than the charged battery for the QC3.I truly think the QC 15's are Bose premiere headphones. While I still think the QC3's probably look a LITTLE bit better and more sporty, you absolutely cannot compare the comfort level between the QC15's and anything else. You trade just a little bit of looks and a little bit of size for a MUCH better product! The case is literally the same size as the 3's .. possibly a quarter of an inch bigger.. but that's it!My Advice: Really truly listen to the clerks' recommendations in the store (They didn't even push the more expensive headphone on me), take your time trying them on, there is no rush for a purchase this major! Last but not least, most definitely don't be shy about returning or exchanging if you feel you have to! Be honest with yourself about the product you buy! ENJOY : )

Once I took them out of the box and used them the first time....well there is NO WAY these are going back. I have watched several movies while jogging on the treadmill and wearing the headphones. They are very lightweight and comfortable. The amount of noise reduction is adjustable and one AAA battery lasts between 30 and 40 hours. I can't wait to use them on the airplane when I travel.</td>

It is comfortable for me so far, about 30 minutes wear time.  I have noticed that there is some leakage of noise from it to the outside, depending on how loud I listen to my music.  Also, the  battery thing is an annoyance.  If the battery is dead, the phones don't work at all.

Some feedback:1) Slightly felt a bit of pressure on the ear drums when using without music but was not uncomfortable at all. Once the music was on, these headphones are a bliss. After a few tries, you get used to the different feeling to be honest.2) Very good and &quot;natural&quot; sound. Not enough beat but I like to enjoy my music that way. Very pleasent to listen to too.3) Excellent noise cancelling. Used it on a recent trip and could not hear any jet noise. You can still hear muffled human voices (perhaps because of the pitch) when the music is turned off. That is actually a plus point for me as I can hear my child when she cries and dont really have to worry about being cut off completely.4) Extremely comfortable. The leather looks very expensive and very soft. Can wear it for hours without putting any stress on your ear.

Excellent for classical musics. You feel like you're in your own personal concert hall. Lightweigt and very comfortable fitting. I use them mainly with my iPod/iPhone.

Missing crispness and quality in the mids, mids/high, and the high. Not enough to bother me by no means. Bose has always made a quality product. These have replaced my beloved Sony Studio Monitors that are 21 years old as my favorite headphones. Still lacking compared to the Etymonic Research earbuds (much more comfortable tho). The noise canceling is second to none, these things are insane.</td>

Provides good soundquality, quietness, and comfort to the user.VERY VERY Comfortable 9.5/10 The leather is very plush and soft and comfortable. My ears dont' get sweaty/hot at all.Noise Cancelation: 9.5/10 Amazing. The world becomes quiet once you turn it on. When the noise cancelation is on you notice a huge improvement(I've heard people complaining about hte pressure and this is true. When you first put it on you get a bit of pressure however once you start playing music, all discomforts go away. It's been a week and my ear's adjusted in 2 days, I experience no discomforts. So keep it mind give it up to a week before returning)Sound Quality 7.5/10: Good, Adequate Sound quality but def. not worth it for the heavy 300 dollar priceBUT honestly people complain and say this has horrible sound quality it does not. The bass is just perfect, the trebles are nice... etc Everything is good. just not Great.The reason i'm giving this a 4 stars instead of a 5 is because of these reasons1) The only average sound quality2) The price tag3) The cord is a tad bit too long (often gets snagged.. but then better it's long than short)Good Luck on your decision. I'm definitely keeping these cans

                <td colspan="4">I am a frequent international traveler and fly over the Pacific very often. My ears are very sensitive with high pitches and whine, so I get quickly tired with background noise especially those ones from cheap headphones. And I am forced to unnecessarily raise the volume because conversation scenes can be frustrating at times with that kind of headphones on. Doing so is not only hassle but also not healthy to my ears. For that matter, these headphones perfectly filtered the natural noise of the airplane and could enjoy the movie without constantly adjusting the volume. It cover your ears very comfortably as well. I highly recommend this to travelers like me.

                        <b>Full user opinion: </b>Bose does make the best noise canceling technology but don't equate that to the best sound quality. No noise canceling headphone will sound better than a good non-noise canceling headphone.If you're not planning on using this for your weekly business flights then you really don't need noise canceling. A good in-the-ear (IEM) headphone or over-the-ear headphone will provide sufficient noise isolation.I'd recommend the Audio Technica ATH-M50 headphones over these from Bose. They are half the price and have a better overall sound. With Bose you're paying for the brand and their huge marketing department.Read this for more info:http://audioproheadphones.blogspot.com/2011/07/headphone-popularity.html</p>

I know it's a cliche, but listening to music through them truly is like hearing it for the first time. I originally bought my husband a pair of these for Christmas and was so blown away that I had to get myself a pair. Bass is deep and punchy, highs and mids are crystal clear, and the separation is second to none. Get these and you'll never buy another brand of headphones.</td>

Sure I'd like a smaller case to carry around, but since covering my ears is part of how they function, there's not much to fault Bose for regarding the size.   I'll just have to get smaller ears. Compared to other headphones, I tire of earbuds being stuck in my ears long before these bother me, and these are among the best sound of any I've used.Just do it.  Your ears are worth it.</td>

                <td colspan="4">Morning all,My high school subscript read, &quot;music ranks highest among the arts.&quot; I also spent a ridiculous amount of money for my home systems to hear as much musical information as I can, so when it came to purchasing my commuter headphones sound quality and musical enjoyment was crucial. I STILL have the pairs of Senn 450s and QC 15s in my possession with the intent on returning one of them. I can compare them till the end of January. Initially, I concur with just about all who have written something somewhere on the internet regarding each of these phones' characteristics. The Senns are superior in sound quality and the QC 15s can't be beat for noise cancellation. If my usage was in an office, at home, or on streets of an average town there would be no issues as to my choice of the Senns. Unfortunately/fortunately, I live in the big apple, and my use of these cans will be on my commuter bus and in the hustle/bustle streets of this large metropolis. I've used both for a couple of weeks and I find that the superior noise cancellation contributes more to being involved in the music. When there are quiet passages, they're quiet. I might be missing some of the subtleties in the music that the Senns produce but they would only be heard in a much quieter environment. In this town, the noise passing through the Senns cancellation system drowns out the nuances they're famous for. The musical spectrum is not as flat, and at times the bass may be a little pronounced, but I actually feel I'm hearing more of the music though the QC 15s. See I even dislike saying the word Bose. I was never a fan of anything they've produced in the past, but in this case, they're filling my needs. The jury is still out, but I'm favoring the QC15s for their noise canceling qualities at this point.What's really scary, is how incredibly loud my everyday environment is when I pop these headphones off for a second or two to see how they're preforming.

                <td colspan="4">I have tried several different kinds of over-ear headphones (Skullcandy SkullCrushers, Beats, etc.) but up until now I had not experienced legitimate noise-cancelling headphones. So far I have been very impressed with these, they really do eliminate background noises and audio sounds extremely crisp and high-quality. Sound Quality:These headphones have very sharp sound. I notice more parts to songs than I had before with other headphones, and music (especially rock) sounds great with these and very detailed. In addition, these headphones are great for blocking out sound. Whether on a flight or a long car ride they block out all road/flight noise. They don't block out loud speaking nearby, but otherwise they really do silence the space around you. These do highlight acoustic noise and clarity, being acoustic headphones, however they don't have bad bass either. I enjoy listening to rap and dub-step just as much as rock and other genres on these earphones, although they are not bass boosting headphones.Design:Bose found a great balance between durability, style and comfort. The headphones fit well over the ears with extra space so wearing them for long periods of time is no problem. The cushioning is also very comfortable on your head the surrounding cushion doesn't press on my ears at all when I'm wearing them. They look very well made (as they are) and sleek with a kind of reserved style to them. Lastly, while not a good idea to throw these around and drop them, they are durable enough and seem to be perfectly solid for everyday use.  They will not break if dropped a few times but always best to be careful as they are not by any means steel-plated.Overall Value:While highly priced, I would say these are definitely well worth it.  They are less than some beats headphones and are definitely better made and definitely have better sound quality (unless you are looking for bass.) If you can come up with the money, don't second guess buying these, you won't be disappointed!

Bose dissapointed me .

                <td colspan="4">There are enough reviews out there comparing various aspects of the QC 3 versus the QC 15 that I'll keep this review relatively brief and focus primarily on a comparison of sound quality.  Simply put, the QC 15 has a very noticeable advantage over the QC 3 when it comes to sound quality.  Because I purchased these headphones primarily for use when flying, I really wanted to like the QC 3 because of the smaller form factor and (slightly) more compact case.  Unfortunately, I just couldn't get past the relatively poor audio quality from the QC 3 headphones.  The headphones otherwise seem well designed, and the noise canceling feature seems to work well, but the audio quality was frankly disappointing.  I'm not an audiophile, but the sound quality of the QC 3 was noticeably worse than the QC 15.  The best way I can describe it is that music sounds very flat, with no depth of sound stage.  The QC 15 is not exactly the best sounding headphones out there (hence, only 4 stars), but they provide noticeably better audio quality compared to the QC 3.

It also had a poorly placed on/off switch that could be easily turned on while being stored. I really like the comfort of Sony's MDR-NC60 (which is now discontinued) and the closest model is the Sony MDR-NC500D, but it's $400 and has less than stellar reviews. I took a chance on the Bose QuietComfort 15, and I LOVE them! They are actually more comfortable than the Sony's, and the noise cancellation and sound quality blows the other two brands out of the water. I'm very pleased and I wouldn't hesitate from buying these if you want the &quot;perfect&quot; noise canceling headphones for work and travelling.

I spend 9 hours with this headphone unplugged, without any music just not to hear the child crying few seats behind.A bit expensive but very efficient.

I will never purchase another Bose product.

When I started nursing school I purchased a pair of these after much debate and have been really pleased with them. They are the perfect gift for a studying college person or traveler. I use them all the time in the library even though the library is supposed to be quiet. They really help to eliminate miscellaneous noise and get you in the study zone faster. The truth is that the sound is very good, but not mind blowing. They are very comfortable and will not fatigue you after several hours of wear. I am confident in saying that it was a very good purchase and the fact it includes a special headphone adapter for the iPhone was just a plus. If your on the fence... please know its worth the money for the sound canceling aspect of the headphones along with the great sound.</td>

                <td colspan="4">OK, let's be fair here. I'm a female audio snob, although not as attenuated to minor sound differences as people who argue about phase at romantic restaurants. I am all willing to give Bose the benefit of any doubt. Females also hear better than men, and my personal hearing was tested superior for my age and sex. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Bose wave radio. I can just about replace my CD player and Harman/Kardon tuner, a gift from my dad, a bigger audio snob than me. :-) The wave radio blows me away, even compared to my bigger shelf Bose speakers. Of course, the bigger ones have more OOMMPH, they're bigger. I'm still not entirely sure these are worth A LOT of money, nearly two car payments or half my rent. They're big, duh. I dislike ANY 'active system,' meaning they have to take up an outlet or battery power. I hate switches. I miss a VOLUME CONTROL here! Have you ever tried to grab a volume control on an Acer 500 tablet??? PAIN!!!! You lose whatever you were watching to do that!!! Why not just stick it on the side and charge five bucks for it? OH, with this, they give you another plug for an Apple that I don't own. Why not make them universal? Does that not make more sense? Why does Apple get another ring on it's plug? That one, however DOES have it's own volume control. It does come with. the semi hard case might also stand up to the Samsonite treatment. To be fair, again, I haven't tested any new headphones minus this set. I either use cheap but comfy ten-dollar ear buds for mostly talking movies, or these new ones for sound. I like 'em pretty well, but they get on my nerves after about 30 minutes. Again, being fair, I use custom made ear plugs for running PA systems  or for playing drums. At 250.00 those ear bud style things make me itch, too. My father thought that noise cancelling headphones would mean you'd miss someone standing next to you on a plane. he, of course, has not been on a plane in 25 years! There's NO WAY you can ignore someone on a plane, God knows I've tried.compared side to side with the cheap but adequate for most people for most applications, using a cheap free portable CD player with the disc &quot; The Nightfly,&quot; by Donald Fagan of Steely Dan, I noted better vocal replication with the expensive set, the Bose. You can barely hear them up loud standin next to someone. It noise cancels pretty well. I think that a lot of what they noise cancel is the same frequency, so it cancels the noise out. If two sounds a are on the same  frequency, you can't hear one at least. Again, you have to compare apples to oranges. Most people will happily listen to BAD Mp3s on a STUNNING Bose Stereo on a Maserati, and never notice it sounds like garbage. I didn't know the music, so I couldn't tell if it was a low bit rate, a bad cable, or bad music. The hiss is likely tape hiss if it was originally recorded on analog tape. It's inherent in the sound, like snaps and pops on a record, which I never could stand, I don't care how great it sounds AROUND that snapping. I'll pick a hissy, worn out cassette, over a new record any day. The inconsistent nature of the pops jars me! if you're really the sort who doesn't know the difference between plain old Sony and Bang and Olufsen, or Harman/Kardon while blindfolded, then please buy the cheaper ones and send the monetary difference to Heifer International, PAWS, or the Smile Train charities. Please make sure you know the difference or it's just a waste of money. Sony or JCV used to be.  A LOT better than they are now. Now, I would say, if you have something old that can be re-coned, I'd recommend that ANY DAY over most of the new stuff.  Because you can rebuild an old item for MUCH cheaper than you can replace it with a new one of the same quality. We chose to re-cone very old 1980s AR floor speakers that must have been a few grand back then for 350.00 for three ways over try and replace them when it couldn't be done for anywhere near that price, and then someone HERE has a job. And I swear they don't even NEED subs! Neither do old JVCs, but they SURE DO NOW!!! I like a warm bass sound, not annoying or overpowering. I listen to classic rock. I like Santana, but I end up turning the bass down (you turn things DOWN, not UP to balance things). Journey never had such great sound, so it's not a great 'test.' Steely Dan is a good choice, as is a GOLD pink Floyd copy of 'Meddle,&quot; if you can find it....I can't imagine what that's worth to someone today....it was about forty bucks back in the 80s! that's two tanks of gas on a big car then! Oh, I'm a HUGE Journey fan, but only with the Steve's or before.

It's hard to listen to music with any other headphones now. I don't have any experience with different brands of noise cancellation headphones so I can't make a comparison, but I'm satisfied spending the amount I did on them for sound quality alone.That being said, they do feel a bit flimsy. I'm worried they might break quite easily if anything untoward happened to them. I'm a bit obsessive about carrying the case with me everywhere. If I'm not wearing the headphones, they go into the case. So I wish the build was a little sturdier, but overall, I'm happy with my purchase!

                <td colspan="4">Ok....so I love these headphones. I had a pair of the original active noise cancelling headphones and if you dont know how these headphones cancel sound both passivly and activly then read on brother......the QC15 ARE A MARVEL OF MODERN PHYSICS. they use a set of my microphones for each of the two cups. these microphones are how the active cancelling of sound happens. All you have to do is flip the switch on the side of the right side ear cup and sudennly all the back ground noise on the train bus or airplane is gone. this is acomlished by the calculations that the computer chip in side the headohone makes, specifficaly what happens is that the noise around you is picked up by the mic's and then the headphones send the inverse (or opposite) sound wave into your ear canceling the sound!!!!! amazing right? like i said.....these things are a marvel of modern physics and technology in general. None the less i have one more point to make.....Bose is 100% the best customer service around......if the QC15 have one draw back it would be there durablity......im on my 3rd pair of QC15 and my first two sets broke due to excessive use......Bose made a direct exchange for a brand new pair of QC15 at no cost to me at all........and they did it twice!!!.......and they even renewed my warrenty with each of my new pairs........no word of a lie...........these r seriouse headphones and they will blow your mind at the depth of the sound and the exsperince of hearing only the muisc you love... and nothing else.......thanks</td>

                <td colspan="4">I bought these after returning a disappointing set of Monster Beats by Dr Dre Pro Special Edition Detox headphones which I had purchased for $499. By comparison, these are certainly an excellent value for the price. At $200 less than the Beats - these headphones outperformed the Beats in every way that I can think of except one. The Beats came with a mini to quarter-inch adapter and the QC15's don't include this. The QC's come with an additional iPhone cord (with a mic) which is nice to have.The sound quality is good. One is that I noticed that these headphones sound best at higher volumes. At the higher volumes - the sound quality is thilling and encouraged me to spend much time under these headphones - wanting to hear things that I haven't listened to in years just to hear them through these phones. Look, we all know what the Bose sound is - and these are Bose sound plus better mids than Bose sound. if you like the Bose sound #and I do# you'll love these phones.At lower volumes, there is nothing to really complain about - but they didn't thrill they same as they do at the higher volumes. To my ear, this is true of many Bose products so I kind of expected this. I could be wrong but there were a couple of moments that I thought that I could detect a little bit of the noise cancellation bleed through for a brief instant during a very quiet part of a song. I can't be sure - and there's little way to know as you can't turn the noise cancellation off as far as I know. Even if this were true - the sound was still extremely good but these are the only reasons that I didn't go to excellent.Also - I should note that this is my first set of noise cancelling headphones. The noise cancellation is nothing short of amazing. If all you want is a little quiet, you don't even need to plug in the phones to any audio source - just put on the phones and turn them on. I can't wait for my next flight.I wavered between good and excellent on Comfort. These headphones are light and my ears didn't get too hot. These were very welcome features - particularly compared to the Beats which were both heavy and hot. There was a slight clamping effect at the bottom of the ear pieces, but light enough that most people probably wouldn't notice - and nothing like the heavy clamping of the beats. I wound up on excellent because I can't imagine there being a more comfortable competitor.I haven't owned these for long enough to give them an excellent durability rating. The build quality seems good and, unlike the Beats, everything works as expected. Based on other reviews of the Bose, I have a couple of concerns about the durability that only time will tell. However, they come with a convenient semi-hard case that should keep the headphones pretty well protected. Again, this is yet another thing that didn't come with the higher-priced Beats.I'm extremely happy with this purchase and would certainly recommend these.</td>

But the sound quality really was not that dramatic, although having earphones on your head for seven hours was more comfortable than having earbuds in your ear for that long.The question is is it worth spending three times as much on bulky earphones that are just marginally better than the Shure isolating earbuds?  I dont think so.

Adding some musing with a loud volume will take it to virtually 100% noise reduction.

There are a few things you should know1) The main reason I bought these was for noise cancellation and wow it does not disappoint. In fact, the noise cancellation is so good it feels almost like sensory deprivation experiment in the military, unless you turn some music on. Your brain is used to hearing ambient noise so when you put these on and turn the switch on without any input, it'll feel like you just lost your hearing. This works great on a long haul airline flight.2) The sound quality is really good. MAybe I have never used good headphones but the quality is really good.3) It uses a AAA battery to operate. Now, I had no indication how long it would last so I brought four with me on my trip. I think after almost 10 hours of usage, I was still on the first battery. I was impressed. But you know, it's easy to bring a few batteries just to be safe.4) These completely drown out the sound of the aircraft. Rather than listening to a loud whooshing sound for 16 hours, I had sweet silence.BUY THEM!!!</td>

                        <b>Full user opinion: </b>I've heard many good things about these headphones and eventually I decided to buy myself a pair. I am used to the style of headphones that Sony has brought out, more specifically the extra bass line. I am also used to other lines like Audio Technica and Sennheiser (mainly very high quality sound). I would not consider myself an audiophile as I don't spend any more than $500 on any set of headphones. Coming from a high esteemed company like Bose, I fully expected the Quietcomforts to be nearly perfect in every aspect. Man, was I wrong. When I first put them on, I noticed a huge difference in the sound quality of these and my other ~$300 headphones. The highs were overpowering, the lows were hardly noticeable, and the overall feel of the sound seemed very unbalanced.I do like the noise cancelling, however. I was able to mow my lawn (btw I have a Toro Z5030 ZTR riding mower) and with music playing, I could hardly hear the engine at all. I have to say that I was quite impressed. But noise cancelling isn't my main concern. It is really sad to say that I was extremely disappointed with this pair, and I promptly resold it on eBay. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE OTHER REVIEWS. I fully understand that there are an overwhelming amount of reviews out there saying that the sound quality is excellent. Let me tell you something: I honestly believe that every single person who says that has never even tried to any extent any of the other $300 by other companies out there. I on the other hand have had much experience, and my experience is telling me that $300 is not worth what the QC15 gives you. Plain and simple. I own a pair of Sony MDR-XB1000 headphones, which you can find on eBay for $200, and they just blow the QC15s out of our galaxy. I can by a set of headphones for $20 at Radio Shack that have the same quality of sound that the QC15s do. It's that bad. Even when the music is turned up even slightly loud in the 1000s, I can't hear a single thing anyone is saying unless they yell at me. So take my advice and if you care more about sound quality than noise cancelling, please get something different.</p>

                <td colspan="4">Ok, So I looked up several alternatives to the almighty Bose noise canceling headphones, but couldn't find more reliably good reviews on any other headset. So I bought them, and now I'll share my own opinion: First off- Fantastic job at cancelling constant droning noise and even dampening louder interrupting sounds. Second- really awesome battery life! I have been using the same battery since I bought the set and it's probably been at least 20 hours of solid use. Third- Quiet is good, but so is the SOUND- and you can put the sound on hi or low depending on what you're doing- there's a setting on the adapter that makes this possible- so that you can have music in the &quot;background&quot; or &quot;full force.&quot; Experimentation will make clearer what I'm trying to explain. Anyways, I highly recommend purchasing these, especially if (like me) you really depend on quiet to get some work or studying done. Sanity and quiet have no price!

                <td colspan="4">OK I am an avid music listener of all different genres. The quality of the sound is AMAZING, definitely a crystal clear , and the noise cancelling is great for when I want to block the rest of the world out. However, if you are the kind of person who likes to feel the music as well as hear it, these headphones are not for you. despite the crystal clear sound, these headphones lack bass, which in my opinion allows you to really get the feel of the music. along with minimal bass, these also lack volume. I have to turn my ipod nearly all the way up to get the sound to my liking. I also have a pair of beats by dre. The beats are high in bass and volume but you don't get the clarity that the bose give you. So like I said, it all just depends on the music you like. If you like country, classical, or acoustic music, these headphones will keep you satisfied. But, If you like Hip-hop, dupstep, or rock, you may want to look elsewhere.</td>

                <td colspan="4">I recently received these headphones as a gift, and they are hands down the greatest head phones I have ever heard.The noise-reduction is astonishing. You can't hear ANYTHING but music, no background noise whatsoever. And I can't stress this point enough, it really is incredible how much noise they cancel out. Standing on a busy street corner with these headphones on, listening to music at a very reasonable volume, I like to take them off for a moment and I'm shocked every time by how noisy it is. You really can't understand how well they work until you try them yourself.The sound quality overall is spectacular. Crisp, sharp, perfectly clear music. Every instrument, every voice, every little teeny tiny sound comes through perfectly balanced and clear as a bell. On top of that, Bose makes some of the most comfortable headphones on the planet, as far as I'm concerned. Even these fairly large headphones are surprisingly light-weight, and the around-the-ear padding is so soft you hardly feel it.The only possible issue I have with these would be the price. But if you're a serious music lover, and you have the money, there is no substitute. I will never use another pair of headphones again. I highly recommend classical music. Listening to Beethoven's Piano Concertos on these headphones is one of the greatest things a person can experience.*I suggest, if you're skeptical, go to the Bose store or any good electronics store and find one of the Bose demo setups. You can try them out and you'll hear the difference immediately.

I still hear people talking who are sitting at adjacent desks but it's not distracting. I still hear the phone ring. Removing the headphones after I'm accustomed to the quiet the computer fans sound like jet engines. When listening to music the sound quality from the iPhone is as good or better than any of my other headphones. The cord is thin, flexible and doesn't get in the way. This headset is very light weight and comfortable, I forget that I'm wearing them. I made a phone call with this headset using the audio cable with the microphone for the iPhone. That call was the clearest call ever on the iPhone.

I listen to many types of music and these sound great with all of them. Lots of bass without sacrificing sound quality and clarity. I'd recommend these to anyone willing to spend the coin on $300 headphones.</td>

If I had known how much better the Bose 15 were over the JVC HANC250, I never would have bought the JVC.  I do not use the Bose for headphones, only for their noise cancelling ability.

                <td colspan="4">I was replacing a 6 year old $40 Logitech USB headset. (Naturally, I use it only when I am in front of my laptop unlike QC 15). $299 vs $40. Bose has better noise cancellation. But, I just didn't see $299 win the overall game! The Logitech over the ear model that I was using had similar voice character. Definitely can not say that Bose QC 15 has that much superior sound quality. Hopefully, this will last me a long time to justify the price tag.Updating the review....Sound quality is simply unacceptable for a $300 piece. No bass. I switch back and forth between my standard issue Koss headphones and QE15 and it is amazing how much more musical tones you can hear in Koss. I have played certain songs back and forth many times over these 2 headphones. This particular one I was playing, I can't even hear base guitar on QC15. Noise cancellation is good/excellent.  Caused me to miss a couple of cell phone calls when I was using QC15. (Standard Blackberry ring tone at &quot;Normal&quot; volume setting). If you don't care for that feature and you are still in love with the Bose name, try the AE2/OE2 models. Save you $100+.

                <td colspan="4">I've bought many headphones having to travel on long international flights several times a year. Anyone whose traveled by jet aircraft can attest to how the high pitched engine noise can affect you. If you don't understand this try a pair of Bose headphones during a long flight, the calm, quiet difference becomes major when it blocks out everything except the music or sheer silence. I feel so much more relaxed and better after a flight when I have my Bose. Movies and music really do sound that much better, I hear things I never heard before while wearing these head phones.I've owned some Sony noise canceling Headphones, some in the ear Costco lightweight phones, some Maxwell (Walmart $40) over the ear headphones as a comparison. At first I could not accept the concept that I had to spend $300 on headphones. What it comes down to is you're paying for quality and you'll note the volume of people on planes who also have paid the price and own Bose. The sound quality is one part, the materials stand out as they are the only head phones I can wear for 12 hours which don't hurt my head or ears. My ears don't sweat like the Maxwell's did, they block out far more noise than the Sony's and Costco's. When you switch on the noise reduction you instantly notice the difference. In fact the new QC15's listen to the volume of noise and adjustautomatically. I now can turn the volume down on my ipod and laptop when I play movies and music. It just sounds better and due to the great isolation you hear more.

They feel great, they cancel out noise very well (and I agree with the previous poster, nothing currently on the market will cancel everything out, but these are for planes, trains, the subway, traffic when not driving :), and any other low frequency noise situations).  I'm not a big fan of flying, primarily due to the engine noise, and these help to reduce some of the anxiety.My only complaints are that, if you have no sound playing through them (like if you want to sleep on a plane, and just use them to cancel out the noise), it can feel uncomfortable to your ears, kind of like there's a bit of pressure on your eardrums.  The other is that your ears start to sweat after wearing them for too long.</td>

Bear in mind that people's conversations and higher frequencies are not completely blocked off, but listening to music helps to block most noise in this range. Audio quality is also a big plus, giving music a whole new depth that cannot be heard in common headsets. The only problem I can think of is the secondary cable for smart phones, because it is only iPhone compliant. I wish it was Android too. I'm very pleased with my purchase. I had always been a regular headphones user, but some frequent long flights and the constant presence of these gadgets at airports.. I was amazed that the noise cancelation was so powerful, completely blocking most sounds, specially in the lower frequency range (plane turbines, air conditioning, all those annoying, constant hums).

Well she had the most relaxed flight, didn't worry about a thing- no noises to worry her and when she slept she kept them on to block out the noise.. So now I have lost mine to her and I have to buy another pair.Awsome product I no longer have to push the crappy supplied headphones halfway down my ear canal to listen to movies etc on the plane. These are really comfy and give a great sound. I would recommend them!

The Quiet Comfort 15's have very good noise cancellation, and the sound is INCREDIBLE. At first I never really took the time to just listen to the sound quality, but then I started thinking about getting new headphones for christmas, and so I tested these against my friend's Beats. Bose won, hands down. Beats may have had a stronger bass, but as far as overall quality, the Bose are just better. They are way more comfortable, and also have a mic, which is a plus in my book. Overall, great headphones. Would definitely recommend them.</td>

If they were a little cheaper they would be perfect. The cord seems a little flimsy for heavy duty use. I have a set of David Clarks for the tractor/bushhog, but the audio is dull and there is no noise cancelling.A bonus is that they have both a 3 &amp; 4 pin plug so when using them with an IPOD or IPAD the headset mike is functional. Wokks great for SKYPE in our noisy kitchen.</td>

                <td colspan="4">I have had my Bose QC15's for about two years and I couldn't be happier with them. After going through numerous pairs of earbuds from Apple, Skullcandy, Sony, and Beats, I splurged and bought these. I also I had a pair of the Bose earbuds, which were amazing as well, unfortunately they were misplaced and haven't been found since. I listen to primarily rock but I also listen to a lot of hip hop and these headphones produce such an amazing sound that I will never get another brand of headphones! Bose simply makes the best quality sound systems out on the market!The sound quality that the Bose QC15's have is simply amazing! I have never had the same quality of sound that comes from these headphones. When everyone says that you can hear different parts of the song, they aren't kidding. You can hear hidden rhythms and bass lines and it truely brings the music to life. It feels as though you are actually there with the artist listening to them play. The noise cancellation feature puts these headphones over the top! If you just want peace and quiet, they can be used without the headphone cord and you are instantly immersed in silence. I use my headphones when I'm drumming and they are absolutely perfect! I can just turn on the noise cancellation and it gives my drums a more studio sound, rather than hearing the vibrations bouncing off of the walls. When playing music through them and drumming along I can hear the drums just enough so I can keep with the song but still receive amazing sounds of the music. They truely make listening to music an experience rather than something you do to pass the time.The durability of the Bose QC15&quot;s is great! Just holding them in my hands, I feel as though they can't be broken (although there is a way to break everything haha). You can twist and bend them and torque them in ways that I'd feel worried if I did that with other headphones. Also the design that has the ear pads swivel is much nicer than having them fold inward like some other headphones. Another bonus is the case is very durable and I never worry about damaging the headphones while they are in the case. Only problem is the headphone cord is starting to come apart. The spot where the headphone jack meets the actual cord is starting to separate, but the sound quality hasn't diminished and it's nothing that a little gentle care can't prevent from getting worse. Even if it does, Bose was smart enough to make the cord available by itself for $15. Don't forget, I use these while drumming and exercising, so my ipod has been dropped numerous times, therefore causing the shrink tubing to separate a little.Comfort is a big thing with over the ear headphones and these are wonderful! Just putting them on creates an environment for your ear that isolates it from the outside world and all the unwanted sounds. After about 5 minutes, I can't even tell that I still have them on. Also the band that goes over yor head is well padded and extremely comfortable.Finally, I had originally purchased the Beats by Dr. Dre headphones becasue I thought they looked much cooler. Frankly, I felt way cooler wearing them. The Beats headphones do have an amazing sound quality, but I felt as though they sounded better when hip hop was played through them, whereas every genre of music sounds amazing coming through the Bose QC15&quot;s. Also, the Beats felt rather cheap. The floor model at my local BB had small cracks where the screws secured the ear pads to the top head band. I figured that the floor model would be the best indicator of durability becasue so many people grab them and play with them and the Beats obviously couldn't stand up to the abuse. Along with this, when litening to music with the Beats, everyone could hear what I was listening to, even though my music wasn't at a loud volume. The Beats had much more leakage of sound than the Bose. After having the Beats for about 3 days, I returned them and purchased the Bose QC15's, especially since they were the same price. I haven't looked back since.Overall, after writing this overly-extensive review, my main points are such:PROS:The Bose QC15's give me the best sounding music I have EVER had! They feel amazing on my head. They feel as though they will last forever, and they are the best value if youre looking for great headphones and you believe that the sound of the music is more important than what youre listening to.CONS: They are rather expensive for a college student</td>

                <td colspan="4">For starters, people need to be aware that this device was primarily designed for in-flight noise cancellation. It aims to reduce lower end frequencies like humming of an engine, traffic, train stations, cafeteria's etc. But people have to be reasonable in their expectations. This does not eliminate noise, but reduces it to a level that makes listening music or reading a book in a quieter environment very enjoyable. I've had these for 2 years and it's predecessor for another two years. It does an outstanding job on long flights and since I fly for business at least twice a month I travel always with them. They are genuinely superb. If you are not satisfied with them (as the previous poster), then your expectations of what a noise-cancelling headphone can do may perhaps not be reasonable as these are the best on the market. Ridicously expensive though.</td>

                <td colspan="4">No other headphones at this price point can compare with the noise cancellation of the Bose QC-15s. If eliminating outside noise is what is important to you, this is what you should buy. Period.But the Bose QC-15's sound quality can't compete with many other noise cancelling headphones at this price point. Do a side-by-side test with the Sennheiser PXC-450 or Beats by Dre Studio in a reasonably quiet room, and the difference is startling. The Bose sound almost weak and tinny by comparison. They don't come near the rich, driving sound of the other headphones. It makes you wonder why the hell they cost $300.Now go sit in your car, tune the radio to a static-filled station, and crank it up loud. Plug the Beats into your iPod and listen. You'll have to really turn up the volume to drown out the car radio noise. Same with the Sennheisers. The Bose's noise cancellation, however, will block out most of the static, allowing you to listen to your music at a comfortable volume. Now you know why they cost $300.I did exactly that, using some headphones from friends, and the results convinced me to keep my recently-purchased QC-15s.Not that the Bose sound bad. They're completely adequate, albiet lacking a bottom end and exaggerating some of the highs. But that price tag goes toward noise reduction, not $300-quality sound.They're also extremely comfortable. I wear mine for up to six hours at a time with no discomfort. I love them, but I use to them block out server room noise at work and to get some quiet when traveling by plane or train. If I was using them at home or in situation where I required some, but less, noise cancellation, I would opt for the Beats or Sennheisers.

                <td colspan="4">I was going to buy the mid range pair (with no noise cancelling technology), that are half the price of these.  However, I decided to go to the store and test out both pairs.  There is a marked difference in the filtering of background noise.  I am not an audio techie, and just wanted a great set of headphones that my husband could use when he mows, or on the plane, and these are worth the extra price.  My husband loves them.  The caution is that they are so quiet, you need to be careful and stay aware of your surroundings.  All you hear is music.... or nothing if you don't have them plugged in to an audio device.  This was a splurge, no doubt, but they are comfortable for him, and he has a pretty big head, but he reports no discomfort even wearing them for an hour or two.  He is not bothered at all by the size of them.  Obviously if you are accustomed to wearing just ear buds, this is a whole different genre of headphones.  Again, I thought a bit expensive, but for a birthday or Christmas present, it was extremely well received.

                <td colspan="4">I had a Bose QC 3 that I got as a used item. That was simply awesome. I gave that to my dad and was looking out for a new noise cancelling phone. Got a new synnheiser. Synnheiser was ok but certainly could not match a Bose. In the bose that I got as used I used to hear my old song collection in a new different way and lot of low frequency music was easily and noticably reproduced in Bose. Quite disappointed with Synnheiser I was packing it for returns. I ordered this Bose QC Comfort 15 so that it arrives before I could return Synn. Had few hours of parallel testing and Bose was a clear winner. Although Bose loses on the fact that its not a bluetooth enabled headphone, but for the difference between the prices I can easily get a Bose + bluetooth headset and still cost lesser than synnheiser. Bose is wonderful even as a used item, Synnheisser is bad even as a new item.

Anyway, here is my review. I predict many negative reviews of my review, even though no one will deny what I am writing here:The dictionary definition of &quot;cancel&quot; means &quot;to neutralize or negate the effects of (another)&quot;. &quot;Muffle&quot; means &quot;to make a sound quieter or less distinct&quot;. So these are actually noise-muffling headphones. You can still plainly hear ambient room noise with these headphones on (and the power switch on), albeit muffled, with no music playing. Of course you can drown at that ambient noise by turning the music you are listening to up.The in-line volume/control switch is a nice touch.Am I going to send the headphones back? No.Will I buy them again if something were to happen to these headphones? No. They are not worth $300, in my opinion.

I work at a Data center with over 10000 servers and network equipment with their fans spinning at full throttle to the point that in order to communicate with another person is to yell loud so that they can hear you. Purchasing this headset was going to be the ultimate test and let me just honestly say that the ambient noise in the server room literally just disappeared after turning the noise cancelling on. The only thing I hear is the music and with the volume set at medium not head banging loud. I've even showed it to my co-workers and all of their responses were a complete eye-popping &quot;AMAZING!!&quot;. As far as I'm concern, my search is now over. End of Story.</td>

Pulling them away from my ears to hear all the background sound they were cancelling was the second. I bought them, (way too much money) and thought i'd likely return them. I went out and mowed the lawn with them on. Any idea what it's like to do hated yard work (noisy) and feel like your in your own personal concert hall? Yeah, they're that good. If you love music and can afford them ( or even if you can't), buy a set of these. You won't be disappointed.</td>

Ear plugs (foamies) work great but you need to turn the volume way up on your ear buds to hear anything, or take them out if you want to talk to anyone else. Besides you are probably irritating off the two people you sitting next to on the flight because your having to blast your music. I have also tried to just find in-the-ear headphones that could take care of the jet noise, but again, you have to turn the volume up to hear what you are listening to or take them out to hear the announcements or talk to the flight attendants. Neither of those are great options. What I really wanted in a save-my-hearing headphone was exactly what Bose was offering. They cancel out 90% of all the jet noise and allow me to listen to my iPhone or iPad in flight without having to jack up the volume to a point where I'm doing damage to my ears again. The idea is to protect my eardrums and hearing, not blast them right to hell; and that is what the Bose QC15 does best.</td>

                <td colspan="4">I did a LOT of research before buying a pair of acoustic headphones, and these were the second pair that I bought.  First, I bought Bowers &amp; Wilkins P5 headphones (not noise cancelling, by the way), and I highly recommend them.  I actually spent a lot of time comparing the B&amp;Ws and the QC15s side-by-side.  My conclusion:  if you are in a reasonably quiet room, the B&amp;W P5 headphones have slightly better sound -- the highs are ever so slightly crisper, and the lows every so slightly more true.  However, the B&amp;Ws let all sorts of outside noise in to your ears, and allow your music / podcast / whatever out to the ears of other people around you.  If there is a television on in the background, or a train whistle, or people conversing, you will hear it.Environments where there is a lot of background noise is where the  QuietComfort 15s are unmatched.  I have used them when using a leaf blower, lawn mover, and power tools.  I have used them at a pro football game, and on airplanes.  I have yet to find a situation where I cannot hear my audio source without a problem (though in the loudest environments I do have to increase the volume a few clicks).  I tried to use the non noise-cancelling B&amp;W P5s in these situations and they were completely overwhelmed by the background noise.It is too bad that this class of headphone has come to be known as &quot;noise cancelling&quot; -- &quot;noise reducing&quot; is more accurate.  You can still hear people talking, engines running, or the sound of a television.  It is all just brought down to a level that it is much less distracting and that you can focus on the sounds you want to hear.So, my B&amp;Ws give me the purest, sweetest sound, but my QC 15s are far more versatile and almost match the B&amp;W sound quality.  If I could have only one, it would be the QC 15s.

                        <b>Full user opinion: </b>I'm generally a fan of Bose products. Design and build quality are areas where they've always excelled. But while the noise reduction in these active headsets are good, they are not best available. If you're looking for the best active noise reduction headsets, check out the Sennheiser PC-450. Sennheiser delivers not just great noise reduction, but they don't skimp on sound quality. Plus there's a bypass feature if your battery dies.I prefer the Bose over ear design to their on-ear. The seal around the ear makes for a better listening experience. Thankfully these models are much improved with every design. Bose has come a long way from their first effort-- a bulbous design with a rather hallow sound-- which inevitably knocked against everything and generally annoyed. This revision is much sleeker, though disappointing in sound quality and to my ears-- tiring over time. For the record-- I've since moved to in-ear monitors, which are less obtrusive. You can bet better sound out of a pair of cans-- but my listening rig of choice is currently Ultimate Ears Reference monitors. Granted-- a massive jump in price (by a factor of 3), but providing excellent noise cancellation better than most cans on the market-- and they won't mess up your hair!</p>

This makes me feel a little weird at times. But holy cow - this is an impressive piece of technology. The noise canceling function is extremely good - the best I've used yet. The overall sound quality is what you would expect from Bose. What's great about these headphones is that you get outstanding sound quality in an airplane. The noise canceling takes care of the ambient noise and the headphones take care of the rest. It makes for a great flying experience.</p>

It is bigger, but the comfort in wearing it and the quietness it gives is unbeatable. I sometimes fly a turbo-helix plane and with the PXC-300 the only choice was to listen to rock music, or just noise. Now, I can easily watch a film and listen to quiet conversations or just go for piano music. If you travel a lot, this is portable bliss - just forget all the noise around you and relax. Just be careful not to miss the plane!</p>

Things have changed.  These headphones are amazing, but these aren't for everyone.  Who should buy these?  People that are easily irritated by random noises, ambient noise, that kind of thing.  What's that?  On my list, I'd put in dog barks, refrigerator hums, bathroom pipes, passing cars, wind and rain, etc.  I'm very sensitive to noise.  I bought a wall clock specifically without a ticking noise because it drives me insane.  A couple months ago, some dude moved into a nearby apartment unit.  He's got some kind of affliction that is a cross between emphysema and tourette's syndrome.  He'll make some sort of &quot;Hnnghh!&quot; sound every minute or so right out his window.  This goes on all day and all night and for someone like me who is easily annoyed, it can make a muhfuh go postal.  Now, I'm a headphone nerd.  I've got a Sennheiser HD-650, a Denon AH-D2000, tried all the upper-middle class Beyerdynamics, Audio Technicas and what have you.  How's this sound in relation to the grade A audiophile headphones?  The sound signature on these is a bit less bassy than your average Bose product.  If I use bass boost on my iPod Touch, it sounds about right.  It doesn't compete with my HD-650 or D2000 and you should not buy these if all you want is great music.  You should buy this if you can't stand stupid little distracting noises that drive you up the wall.  Have ADHD?  This is the headphone for you.  You can turn it on (one AAA non-rechargeable battery) and let noise cancelling work.  You can detach the wire so that nothing is in your way if you just really want to get work done.  I'm studying for the BAR Exam and little noises can derail an entire day.  You might be saying to yourself that you can just use earplugs instead of spending $300.  And you can.  I've used earplugs for the last few years.  These headphones are so much more comfortable, they block more noise, and you can actually put on music if you want.  It's one of those things that you didn't know you needed until you have it.  You'll also notice how you can leave the volume very low on your music player because there's no need to drown out extraneous ambient noise.  The perfect headphone for people with tinnitus.  Now, the aesthetics.  Let's face it, these look like garbage.  Who's the kind of person that thinks these look good?  Look at the stock photo.  Those are the people.  No style, no taste.  People who collect glass figurines.  Those people.  So this purchase is going to strictly be a utilitarian one.  Yes, it looks like crap.  But more importantly, it neutralizes noise.  My God, it's about as close as you can get to enjoying the silence of the night desert while living in the heart of a downtown metropolis.  If you're OCD about noise, if you're the kind of person who stays up all night on the internet and can't get to sleep for stupid reasons, if refrigerator buzzing, laundry and dishwasher cycles, passing cars bug you more than it does other people, then look no further.  Sell your kidney on the black market and get these ugly headphones.

At first, I thought paying $300 for a pair of these headphones was well worth the high price, but when the sound went out in the left channel after only 18 months of mild use, it was as if the needle on the record scratched and the Quiet Comfort party was over! Oh, but wait.... you mean I can just replace the audio cord for $30? Fine. If it means I can party again with great sound quality, why not? Well, Not So Fast! When I received my audio cord replacement and plugged them into the headphones, the left channel still wasn't working. It was far worse than a simple fix. Actually, there IS NO FIX. Bose only gives you a one year warranty on this product and I was 18 months into my purchase. There is NO REPAIR PLAN for these pricey headphones and you have to buy a new replacement pair if it breaks or fails after that first year. So, basically, I have to throw these $300 headphones into the garbage because they are no use with the sound coming only into one ear. The best that Bose could do for me was to offer a new pair for $99. That makes my $300 headphones a $429 pair of headphones??

                <td colspan="4">These headphones distort at high volumes and sound flat when using for playback in a recording studio.  They barely reach a satisfactory high volume level when listening to music on an iPhone or iPod.  Even with the high settings on the earphone plug that jacks into the earphone.  Noise canceling works well for wanting some quiet while reading.  Beats by Dre studio sound incredible on iPhone, iPod and via playback through sound card in my home recording studio, however they too distort but only at the 8 -10 max range on volume; they have a fuller sound from 1-8 volume setting (low to three quarters of the way up) The Bose are comfortable and clear but the clarity and sparkle just isn't there as they are with the beats by dre studios.  I'm still a big fan of Bose (surround speaker system) but they need some improvements in tuning these headphones for better sound.

                <td colspan="4">I have seen many reviews saying about the low quality of the headphones. But when I first opened the headphones, I was utterly impressed with how it was made and look. Not only does it sound good, but it makes you stand out your headphones against others.This is definitely a good set of headphones to purchase if noise canncelation is really needed for better audio quality.However, some people will not be able to take the stress of the ears being &quot;blocked&quot; by the noise cancellation.Hence its really up to user's preference. Personally for me, I have no problem whatsoever and I am able to use it comfortably for long periods of time.A headphone that is well build, sound good and delivers true promise to what users want for, is a definite buy for me!
